**Song Title: "Scanning the Logs"**

[Verse 1]  
Another quiet night, the system hums  
But in the shadows, something's begun  
Lines of code on the screen flash fast  
A breach is here, it won’t last  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tracing signals in the stream, oh no  
Encrypted whispers, where do they go?  
Firewalls crumbling, can’t let it slide  
Time to dive deep, protect what’s inside  

[Chorus]  
I’m scanning the logs for the cracks in the armor  
Hacker penetration, i've got to try harder  
Every byte, every trace, I'll find where you hide  
Defending the gates from the other side  

[Verse 2]  
Backdoor open, but I’m closing it quick  
Every strange IP, every clever trick  
Packets are shifting like ghosts in the code  
But I’m on the hunt, I control the payload  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tracing the path, dissecting the clues  
The network's pulse, I refuse to lose  
Silent alarms are screaming in my mind  
I’ll track you down, every trace you left behind  

[Chorus]  
I’m scanning the logs for the cracks in the armor  
Hacker penetration, i've got to try harder  
Every byte, every trace, I'll find where you hide  
Defending the gates from the other side  

[Bridge]  
Lines of defense, I’ll fortify  
Ciphered secrets I will untie  
The game you play, I’ll never fall  
I stand guard, protect it all  

[Outro]  
I’m scanning the logs, on the hunt for the breach  
Your moves are close, but you’re out of reach  
You won’t get in, no, not tonight  
I’ll stand my ground, I'll win this fight  

[Final Chorus]  
I’m scanning the logs for the cracks in the armor  
Hacker penetration, i've got to try harder  
Every byte, every trace, I'll find where you hide  
Defending the gates from the other side  (side--side--side)
